# Aevora

This is my personal blog website built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). It features a clean and modern design, and supports Markdown and MDX for content creation. See the website live at [imiloin.netlify.app](https://imiloin.netlify.app/) (template only site: [aevora.netlify.app](https://aevora.netlify.app/)).

## Project Structure

In this Astro project, you will find the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── configs/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── scripts/
│   └── styles/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Blog posts are stored as `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/blog/` directory.

Any static assets, such as images, are located in the `public/` directory.

## Getting Started

To install and set up Astro on your machine, follow the instructions in the [Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/).

Once you have Astro installed, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server that you can access at [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321/).

> Note: To ensure the search feature works properly, you might need to run `npm run build` before `npm run dev` to generate the index for Pagefind.

## Commands

All commands should be run from the root of the project in your terminal.

> It is recommended to **use Bash** for running these commands. If you are using Windows, consider installing Git Bash. Running `npm run build` in the Windows Command Prompt could lead to issues.

| Command                   | Action                                                            |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs project dependencies                                     |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts the local development server at `localhost:4321`           |
| `npm run build`           | Builds production site and outputs it to `./dist/`                |
| `npm run clean`           | Removes the `./dist/` directory and dumped cache in `public/`     |
| `npm run preview`         | Previews build locally before deployment                          |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Executes Astro CLI commands, such as `astro add` or `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Displays help for using the Astro CLI                             |

If you encounter the following error:

```text
Failed to run pagefind via the npx wrapper: Error: Failed to install either of [pagefind_extended, pagefind]. Most likely the platform windows-x64 is not yet a supported architecture.
```

it is most likely a network issue. Try fixing your network connection and reinstall the package by running `npm install pagefind --force`.
